# Hello, World!

Knowledge is good, organized knowledge is better.

All the information contained here is the result of my experiences as a consultant, official documents (OWASP, CEH, etc.) or even various research produced during CTFs.

I have chosen to make this information public, because access to knowledge must be free and fair for all.
